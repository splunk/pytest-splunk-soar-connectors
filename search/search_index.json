Quick Start Within your projects virtual environment, run: pip install pytest-splunk-soar-connectors What does the plugin do? The main feature of the plugin is that it provides a set of python packages that mock the Splunk SOAR Python environment. It's purpose is similiar to the phantom-test-harness project and some of the features fo the phantom-dev framework. Design Goals Be easy to integrate into pytest suites Work well with existing connector implementations Create test suites that can run as part of CI Why would I use this? It provides an easy way to test Splunk SOAR connectors. Combining it with other pytest packages such as requests-mock or vcrpy , SOAR connectors can be tested in total isolation, without a development SOAR instance or even access to the external system. Any examples? Please take a look in the tests folder of the Redmine connector for an example of a test suite using this package.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#welcome-to-pytest-splunk-soar-connectors","text":"pytest-splunk-soar-connectors is a plugin for the pytest framework that provides a set of mock packages and fixtures for unit testing Splunk SOAR Apps (Connectors) .","title":"Welcome to pytest-splunk-soar-connectors"},{"location":"#quick-start","text":"Within your projects virtual environment, run: pip install pytest-splunk-soar-connectors","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"#what-does-the-plugin-do","text":"The main feature of the plugin is that it provides a set of python packages that mock the Splunk SOAR Python environment.
